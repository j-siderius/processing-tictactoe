# TicTacToe 

### Dynamically scalable TicTacToe made in Processing

The game can be dynamically changed in size at the start (change the fieldSize variable, e.g. fieldSize=4 results in a 4x4 playing field). The game logic will check for a n-in-a-row, with n being the total length.

Program is controlled by three main functions:
- drawBoard(), draws the playing board using images for lines, noughts and crosses
- clickBoard(), handles when the player clicks the board
- checkBoard(), checks all possible directions for a n-in-a-row

The game is controlled using the mouse

Player win message and tie detection
